Has can use vaccinespotter.org and/or findashot.org to find COVID-19 vaccines within a certain vicinity. It tweets the locations (closest first) as a reply to a Twitter message at configurable intervals.

## Configuration
1. Acquire Twitter Developer API access, and enter your credentials as they prescibe in a twitter4j.properties file under the resources directory.
2. application.properties has the following configurable items:
#### location.lattitude
Lattitude for your starting location
#### location.longitude
Longitude for your starting location
#### distance.max.miles
The max radius around your starting location to search
#### tweets.max.multi
If your tweet goes too long, this script has potential to break messages up in to multiple tweets. This defines the max amount of tweets.

## Current running setup
This can run anywhere that supports JAVA - however, I'm currently running this on a Raspberry Pi Zero! As such, you'll notice that the source compatibility in build.gradle is set to JAVA 8. 
For a Pi Zero, you'll probably want to run a light OS - I'm using Raspberry Pi OS Lite. Use the openjdk-8-jre-zero apt package to run JAVA 8 on the Pi Zero.

## Run it
This is a Java Spring app, so all rules apply. You can...
Run it from the project root:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
Or, do as I do and deploy it as a JAR, and run that
```
./gradlew bootJar
nohup java -jar covid-pinger-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
```
